    transcriptText: `This tutorial covers Limits and Continuity, essential topics for JEE Advanced Mathematics. 
    
    We begin by defining limits as the value a function approaches as the input approaches some value. Understanding this concept is critical for calculus.
    
    Next, we explore important properties of limits, including sum, product, and quotient rules. We also discuss special techniques for evaluating limits when direct substitution leads to indeterminate forms.
    
    For continuity, we examine the three conditions required for a function to be continuous at a point. We analyze different types of discontinuities, such as removable, jump, and essential discontinuities.
    
    The Intermediate Value Theorem is presented as a powerful tool for proving the existence of roots within a given interval.
    
    Finally, we work through practice problems typical of JEE Advanced examinations to reinforce these concepts and prepare you for the challenging questions you'll encounter on the exam.`

Hello everyone! Today, weʼre going to explore three important types of averages: Arithmetic
Mean, Geometric Mean, and Harmonic Mean. These are powerful tools for understanding data
and solving a wide variety of problems, especially in exams like the JEE.
Letʼs start with the Arithmetic Mean, or AM. The mean is a measure of central tendency, which
simply means it tells us what a “typical” value in a dataset looks like. The Arithmetic Mean for
ungrouped data is the sum of all observations divided by how many there are. Itʼs the “fair
share” value or the balance point of the data.
For example, if your scores are 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30, you add them all up to get 100, and then
divide by 5. So, the arithmetic mean is 100 divided by 5, which equals 20.
Sometimes, numbers repeat in our data. For example, if a score of 10 appears three times, we
say its frequency is 3. To find the mean in this case, we multiply each value by its frequency,
add them all up, and divide by the total number of observations. For example, if your data is 5,
10, 15 with frequencies 2, 4, 3, you calculate (52) + (104) + (153) = 10 + 40 + 45 = 95. The
total frequency is 2 + 4 + 3 = 9. So, the mean is 95 divided by 9, which is about 10.56.
When data comes in groups or intervals, like ages 010, 1020, and so on, we use the midpoint
of each group as its value. Multiply each midpoint by its frequency, add them up, and divide by
the total frequency to get the mean. For example, for classes 010 and 1020 with frequencies 5
and 10, the midpoints are 5 and 15. So, (55) + (1015) = 25 + 150 = 175. The total frequency is
15. The mean is 175 divided by 15, which is about 11.67.
Dealing with large numbers? Use the assumed mean method! Pick a value close to your data as
the “assumed mean,” find how far each value is from it, and use those differences to make
calculations easier. For example, if you use 5 as the assumed mean, the deviations for 5 and 15
are 0 and 10. Multiply each deviation by its frequency, add them, and divide by the total
frequency. Then add this correction to your assumed mean.
If your data groups are evenly spaced, you can make things even simpler. Calculate the
difference from the assumed mean, divide by the class width, and work with these smaller
numbers. This step-deviation method is a real time-saver!
Not all numbers are equally important. Sometimes, we give more “weight” to certain values.
Multiply each value by its weight, add them up, and divide by the total weight. For example, if
do not write slide numbers , just give full as a text
file
1 2 3 4
Physics has a score of 80 with weight 3, and Maths has 90 with weight 2, the weighted mean is
(803 + 902) divided by (3+2), which is 420 divided by 5, or 84.
What if you have two groups, like boys and girls, with their own averages? To find the overall
mean, multiply each groupʼs mean by its size, add them, and divide by the total number of
students. For example, if 30 boys average 70 and 20 girls average 80, the combined mean is
(3070 + 2080) divided by 50, which is 74.
The mean has some very useful properties. First, the mean is a balance point: the sum of the
differences from the mean is always zero. If you add or subtract the same number to every
value, the mean changes by that amount. If you multiply every value by a constant, the mean
also gets multiplied by that constant. And if you use both multiplication and addition, the mean
transforms in the same way. This is called a linear transformation.
Hereʼs a cool fact: if you want to minimize the sum of the squared differences from a number, the
mean is the best choice. This property is the foundation for variance and standard deviation in
statistics.
Now, letʼs talk about the Geometric Mean, or GM. This mean is used when numbers multiply, like
in growth rates or percentages. Multiply all the values together, then take the nth root, where n is
the number of values. For example, the GM of 2, 4, and 8 is (248) to the power of 1/3, which
is the cube root of 64, or 4. GM is only for positive numbers.
For grouped data, raise each value to the power of its frequency, multiply, and take the nth root.
GM is perfect for average growth rates, percentage increases, and index numbers. For example,
if a value doubles in year 1 and triples in year 2, the average growth factor is the square root of
23, which is about 2.45.
The Harmonic Mean, or HM, is used for averaging rates, like speed. Take the reciprocal of each
value, find their average, and then take the reciprocal again. For example, the HM of 1, 2, and 4
is 3 divided by (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/4), which is 3 divided by 1.75, or about 1.71. HM is always the
lowest of the three means.
For grouped data, HM uses frequencies just like the other means. A classic application is finding
average speed when a journey is covered in segments of equal distance but at different speeds.
For example, if you travel from A to B at 40 km/h and return at 60 km/h, the average speed is
not 50! Use HM: 2 divided by (1/40 + 1/60), which equals 48 km/h.
Hereʼs a key relationship: For any set of positive numbers, AM is always greater than or equal to
GM, and GM is greater than or equal to HM. In symbols, AM ≥ GM ≥ HM. For two numbers, the
product of AM and HM equals the square of GM.
In exams, you might find a mistake in your data. Donʼt worry! Just subtract the wrong value, add
the correct one, and recalculate the mean. For example, if the mean of 100 items was 50, but
two values were misread as 92 and 8 instead of 192 and 88, recalculate by adjusting the total
sum and dividing by 100.
Sometimes, you need to find the percentage of a group given combined means. Set up an
equation using the combined mean formula, plug in the numbers, and solve for the unknown
percentage. For example, if the mean age of men and women is 35, menʼs mean is 40, and
womenʼs is 32, you can find the percentage of men using the combined mean formula.
The AM-GM-HM inequality is a powerful tool for proving inequalities or finding minimum and
maximum values in algebra and calculus. For example, for positive a, b, and c, (a+b+c)
(1/a+1/b+1/c) is always at least 9.
Finally, avoid common mistakes: use the right mean for the right situation, double-check your
calculations, and remember the properties and relationships we discussed. Practice different
types of problems, and youʼll be ready for any question on means!
Great job, everyone! With these tools—AM, GM, and HM—you can handle any average you
meet in math, science, or exams. Keep practicing, and youʼll master these concepts in no time!
